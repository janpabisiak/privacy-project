# Privacy Project - Make your devices yours.
I wrote this tutorial for my friend, but I decided to publish it. Use as much as you want. Don't forget to give me a Star :)

### 0. Keep updated
For example: Intel's Chips can be hacked & WPA2 is not safe anymore. Follow news about IT.

### 1. Encrypt your hard drives
Encrypt your disks, it will give you the certainty and security that if someone steals your device, they won't be able to read anything from it (of course, as long as you set a good password in the encryption program). Do not use BitLocker for encryption, as it is not confirmed that the Microsoft company that made this software has no special decryption tools that they could give to your enemy. Use [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/) to encrypt your disks. The program has never let me down and is easy to configure.

### 2. Encrypt your E-mail as well
Abandon the use of non-privacy/non-encrypted e-mail services and bet on well-encrypted ones. This will ensure that your data is not used against you and keep your correspondence secure. I personally use [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) (2084 encryption or 4098bit encryption). They have "No Log Policy" and it is trustworthy company as well. Assures you the servers never had been compromised. But remember: the most ideal option is to host your own SMTP server for email.

### 3. Install awesome extensions
- [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) - its task is to assess the extent to which the website cares about our privacy, whether the terms of using it are friendly, and it can inform user about external components that track activity like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - the name says it all. This extension will force websites to turn on the encrypted HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP.
- [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org) - will automatically block the most popular tracking tools placed on most WWW websites.
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - extension available on most web browsers which can blocks ads and tracking scripts, and at the same time is easy to use and consumes little computer resources.

### 4. Stop using the same password on many websites. 
Make your passwords strong (just use password generator which can generate for you nonsense passwords, the hardest to break) and unique on every website that you use. Make your passwords over 30 characters long and change passwords every 6 month. If you use a weak password like password123 or qwerty123 a machine can guess that within seconds so someone can get into your account within minutes. Don't save passwords in txt file or on the paper near to device. Just use Password Manager cuz this is tool where you can save your password safe.
I can recommend you:
- [1password](https://1password.com)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) [FREE PLAN]
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) [FREE PLAN]

### 5. 2FA is very well thing
If the website you are using has the 2FA option, please enable it. 2FA is a powerful tool in the fight against intrusion attempts to your accounts.

### 6. Use VPN but make sure that it is good one.
Choose to only use a VPN that has adequate encryption and a privacy policy. Your VPN should also not use logs to save connections. I recommend [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com) (a software from the same provider as ProtonMail). ProtonVPN never had DNS leaks. ProtonVPN has FREE plan also so why don't get it? For additional security, you may be interested in cryptocurrency payment availability.

### 7. Don't connect to Tor without being connected to VPN previously.
Simply do not. Better safe than sorry.

### 8. Google Chrome opt-out
Instead of Google Chrome, which doesn't care about privacy, it's better to use [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/new/). It is an open source browser, which means that you can always look at its code and see if everything is okay. It has advanced anti-fingerprinting features and protects against tracking scripts, which makes it more difficult to track your internet activity.

### 9. Performs a privacy & security check of Windows 10
Just use [PrivateZilla](https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla) "Privatezilla integrates the most critical Windows 10 privacy settings and allows you to quickly perform a privacy check against these settings. Active settings are marked with the status "Configured" and indicates that your privacy is protected. The inactive ones are declared as "Not configured". All available settings (currently 60) can be enabled as well as disabled.". If you plan to be full anonymity/security/privacy driven, ditch Windows and move onto a OS where you have more control over what system does. Get into Linux (if you don't want to throw windows to trash bin, you can use Virtual Machine).

### 10. Don't use Google
Google saves everything you have searched for and a lot of other data about you. For your own safety, you should opt out of using Google whenever possible. A good replacement for Google that supports privacy and anonimity is [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).

### Bonus. Don't use Social Media
Social Media aren't your friends. The relationship between users and social media is more like keeping a parasite on you. Most social media do not respect privacy because people are their commodity. If you don't need some social media remove your account on it.
